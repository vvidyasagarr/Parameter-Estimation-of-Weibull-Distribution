PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION USING MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD


The Weibull distribution is commonly used to model the lifetime of a system or component. Parameter estimation of the Weibull distribution plays a crucial role in reliability analysis and decision-making in engineering and other fields.
Two popular methods for estimating the parameters of the Weibull distribution are maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Bayesian estimation. In this report we are providing CRB, and detailed step-by-step procedure for performing parameter estimation using MLE of two-parameters using Newton Raphson method. We also applied Monte-Carlo for better estimation.We have applied our result to a dataset and we also computed the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Test and R2 Test.
